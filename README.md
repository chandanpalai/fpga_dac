fpga_dac
========

Project which creates an analogic sine signal from of an architecture that involves FPGA. It were used a DDS core to generate the sine and SPI communication to control DAC conversor (AD5791 Analog Devices). To choose the sine frequency and the update frequency of a new data we developed a cpp application. The "documentation" folder has more details of the project, including datasheets, state machine and block diagram.
